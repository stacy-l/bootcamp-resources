    "# Other useful bash commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands below are extremely useful but will not be covered in this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "## mkdir\n",
    "This will make a new, empty directory for you. Just use it as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir <pick a directory name you want to make up>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will make a new directory in the current directory\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also chain it with the \"/\" symbol.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir ../<directory name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will make a new directory in the one that's a level higher\n",
    "\n",
    "## cp\n",
    "**cp** is used to copy files or directories. To copy a file, just use the command as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp <file to copy> <name of copy>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Like in previous examples, you can also use file paths to copy files to and from different directories. A new thing to introduce here is the \".\" When you use the \".\" for the name of copy section, it means to save it here. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp ../<some file> .\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means that I'm copying some file from the directory above to the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## mv\n",
    "**mv** is just like cp, except you're moving files/directories from one location to another instead of copying them. The usage is the same:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mv <file to move> <new location>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Keep in mind that if the new location ends in a directory, then the file will be moved into that directory. Otherwise, it will be moved and renamed to the new location name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## rm\n",
    "**rm** will delete files or directories. Please use this with caution, as you don't want to accidentally remove hard earned, unbacked data. General usage is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "rm <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will delete the file you specify. To delete a directory, you have you use the __-r__ option.\n",
    "This is also a good time to introduce regex and the wildcard function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wildcards\n",
    "\n",
    "The star functions as a \"wild-card\" character that matches any number of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd ..\n",
    "$ ls *txt\n",
    "greetings.txt  pythons_of_the_world.txt  wishes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The star can go anywhere in a list of arguments you're supplying, even in the middle of words! There are other wildcards you can use but * is the most common."

    "## Pipe\n",
    "pipes allow you to string together a series of functions together. Here's how it generally works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function_A <file> | function_B | function_C\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means you perform function_A on a file, then function_B on those results, and then function_C on those results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the file called sample_a.txt. Using the **more** command, we see that it's full of greetings and goodbyes. I want to count the number of lines that says hello.\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep \"hello\" sample_a.txt | wc -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputting\n",
    "So far, everything we've done results in something appearing on the screen in front of us. What if we want to save the results into a file? That's where outputting come into play.\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls > files.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will save the list of all files and folders in the current directory into a file named files.txt. If there's already a file named \"files.txt\" in your directory, it will overwrite it! Be careful when using this function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appending\n",
    "Everytime we use \">\" to output into a file, it will overwrite the output if it already exists. Appending, or using\">>\" will add stuff to the end of a file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls >> files.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these functions use some special characters, if you want to search for these special characters using ```grep``` (or any other special character), make sure to use single quotes around them. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep '$' <some file>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means to look for the dollar sign symbol in some file"
